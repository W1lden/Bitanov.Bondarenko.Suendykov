** http://www.flightarcade.com/learn/gamepad
* fix lighting, things look super ugly without better lighting. tv should be emitting glow
* fix scale, things are too big
* add more 80's nostalgia esp. to the back wall a la https://sketchfab.com/models/9583c76fa1b74dafaa0b8912a66613f8
* improve overlay UI including a close/hide button
* improve progressive loading experience and order (load black, then static, then tv model, then room, then emulator, then skybox last)
* map nes controls to vive / oculus touch, and/or experiment with xbox controller
* allow user to choose alternate environment / backgrounds
* allow switching of games from inside of vr using cartridges
* multiplayer online
